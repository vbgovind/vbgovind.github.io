      Currently a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Irvine. My area of study is Computer Engineering. I finished my Master's degree at UCI in Computer Engineering in 2022, 
      and my Bachelor's degree from Vellore Institute of Technology in 2020.

      In my graduate research I have been involved in creating an instruction accurate simulation of a novel cache-less computer architecture called as the Grid of Processing Cells (GPC) 
      with a team of graduate students. We use SystemC, which is discrete event simulator, for the purposes of this research work. 
      32-bit RISC-V cores are used for simulation and the results shows that GPC can be a viable alternative to shared memory processors for embedded systems.
